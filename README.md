# hb-sandbox

The `hb-sandbox` repository is a development environment for compiling and testing WebAssembly (WASM) code in the context of the HyperBeam project. It provides the necessary tools and Docker configurations to compile source code into WASM files and integrate them into the HyperBeam repository for testing and further development.

## Purpose

The `hb-sandbox` is designed to:

- Build a WASM compiler for generating WASM files from source code.

## Documentation

For detailed instructions on setting up the environment, compiling the WASM, and running tests with HyperBeam, please refer to the full documentation:

[https://permaweb.github.io/hb-sandbox](https://permaweb.github.io/hb-sandbox)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the `hb-sandbox` repository.
2. Follow the [prerequisites](https://permaweb.github.io/hb-sandbox/prerequisites) to install necessary dependencies (like Docker, Erlang, and Rebar3).
3. Use the provided scripts to build the WASM compiler and integrate the WASM into the HyperBeam project.

For more detailed steps, please refer to the [WASM Compiler Setup](https://permaweb.github.io/hb-sandbox/wasm_compiler_setup), [Using the WASM in Hyperbeam](https://permaweb.github.io/hb-sandbox/using_wasm), and [Hyperbeam Repository Setup](https://permaweb.github.io/hb-sandbox/hyperbeam_repository_setup).
