# **Overview**

Welcome to the documentation for setting up and running the WASM compiler and Hyperbeam repository. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the necessary components, compiling the WASM, and configuring the Hyperbeam repository to run and test effectively.

## **WASM Compiler and Hyperbeam Setup**

This section covers the steps required to set up and run the WASM compiler, as well as configuring and testing the Hyperbeam repository. Follow the instructions to prepare your environment and ensure smooth operation.

- **[Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)**: Instructions for installing the necessary dependencies such as Docker, Erlang, Rebar3, and optional tools like LLVM and WAMRC.
- **[WASM Compiler Setup](wasm_compiler_setup.md)**: Learn how to build and configure the WASM compiler, generate a Docker image, and compile source code into a WASM file.
- **[Hyperbeam Repository Setup](hyperbeam_repository_setup.md)**: Clone the Hyperbeam repository, compile the code using Rebar3, and get Hyperbeam up and running.
- **[Running Tests with Your Custom WASM](running_tests_with_your_custom_wasm.md)**: Steps to integrate your generated WASM file into the Hyperbeam repository, modify tests, and run them.
